## Set up
Installing all dependencies

    $ npm install

## Build and run
- Build source scripts

    `$ npm run build`
    
    Both `app.js` (development script) and `app.min.js` (production script) will be output in `./dist/` folder. 

    In development environment, simply use `$ npm run dev` will work, which is faster than `$ npm run build`.

- Serve up the site

    `$ node ./main.js`

- Navigate to `localhost:8000` in browser
